Using sample data from a fictional supermarket chain (Food mart data), I applied Power Query to perform shaping, blending and exploring my project files, and created completely automated loading procedures. From there I applied Data Modeling to design database and perform normalization including table relationships, cardinality, and hierarchies. I created my own relational database to analyze throughout the project. Next, I used Power Pivot and DAX to explore and analyze my data model.
